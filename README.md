# Ford GoBike System Exploration
## by Verah Angwenyi


## Ford GoBike System
> The main objective is to communicate my findings from the analysis that I did on the Ford GoBike System dataset.
  The dataset can be found here; https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
  
## Tools
Python 3.6 | Jupyter Nobebook |numpy | pandas | seaborn | matplotlib

> The analysisÂ in the report relates to trips taken in a bike-sharing program that serves the broader San Francisco Bay region.
  The variables in the dataset include;
  * Trip Duration (seconds)
  * Start Time and Date
  * End Time and Date
  * Start Station ID
  * Start Station Name
  * Start Station Latitude
  * Start Station Longitude
  * End Station ID
  * End Station Name
  * End Station Latitude
  * End Station Longitude
  * Bike ID
  * User Type


## Summary of Findings

> On weekdays, Subscribers tend to go for trips more frequently and consistently than on weekends while the number of customers has rises on weekends starting friday, while it has decreased on Sundays. During peak hours, bicycle trips are most often used.

> In comparison to subscribers, user types that are customers typically travel for longer periods of time.

> The subscriber make most bike trips (90%) while the rest are covered by customers.The gender that dominates most trips are male, followed by female and the other gender takes the least trips.

> There is a fewer percentage of bike sharing. The customers dont share their bikes. Only the subscribers share their trips




## Key Insights for Presentation

> Duration, user type and member gender

> The subscribers are more consistent with their trip duration with majority of the rides being made during  weekdays.

> Customer make longer trips in terms of time taken more than the subscribers
